# REST API Development with Django REST Framework (DRF)

This project is a **RESTful API** built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It demonstrates over **30 different ways** to create API views using:

* ViewSets
* Generic Views
* Mixins
* APIView
* Function-based views (FBVs) *(optional)*

It includes a `Status` app for managing status entries (or similar content types), showcasing the power and flexibility of DRF.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/status/`      | List all status objects       |
| POST   | `/api/status/`      | Create a new status           |
| GET    | `/api/status/<id>/` | Retrieve a status by ID       |
| PUT    | `/api/status/<id>/` | Full update to a status by ID |
| PATCH  | `/api/status/<id>/` | Partial update of a status    |
| DELETE | `/api/status/<id>/` | Delete a status by ID         |

> Depending on the registered URL routes, you may see paths like `/api/status/detail/<id>/`, `/update/<id>/`, or `/delete/<id>/` for class-based views built with `RetrieveAPIView`, `UpdateAPIView`, and `DestroyAPIView`.

---

## 🧪 Demonstrated View Types

* ✅ `ModelViewSet`
* ✅ `ListCreateAPIView`
* ✅ `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`
* ✅ `GenericAPIView` with `mixins`
* ✅ Custom `APIView` subclasses
* ✅ Separate views for List, Create, Update, Delete (CRUD granularity)

All of these are implemented in the `status/views.py` file with clear comments and usage examples.
